# Sarai Muebles – Catalog Access Web System

## Overview
Web-based platform developed for Sarai Muebles that provides controlled access to a furniture catalog through an administrator-generated password system.

## Problem
The business needed a way to:
- Share its furniture catalog digitally
- Restrict access to authorized clients only
- Avoid making the full catalog publicly accessible

A simple public website was not sufficient due to privacy and business control requirements.

## Solution
A web system with two access levels:
- **Administrator**: generates and manages access passwords
- **User**: accesses the furniture catalog using a valid password

The platform ensures controlled and secure access to product information.
